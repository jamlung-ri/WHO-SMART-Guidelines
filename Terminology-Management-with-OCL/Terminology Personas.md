| SMART Guideline Author   | SMART Guideline Authors work broadly to translate clinical guidelines from WHO into artifacts that can be implemented into clinical systems in a clear and consistent manner. They are responsible for: Analyzing WHO clinical guidelines and translate them into computable artifacts; Developing FHIR profiles representing guideline data structures and constraints; Managing versioning of guideline artifacts as clinical guidelines evolve; Collaborating with health IT implementers on practical application | N/A                                   | N/A                                                                                                                                                       |
| Clinical Systems Analyst | Clinical Systems Analysts primarily implement the guidelines, recommendations, tools, and standards of WHO SMART Guidelines into point-of-care systems. They are responsible for: Analyzing WHO guidelines and other health standards; Translating clinical requirements into technical specifications; Developing or customizing health information systems; Ensuring compliance with relevant health standards, directives, and initiatives; Collaborating with healthcare providers to optimize workflows       | Systems Analyst<br />Business analyst | 2511                                                                                                                                                      |
| Health Data Coder        | A Health Data Coder primarily works with local patient and clinical data, assigning codes that align with international standards. Their goal is to quickly understand the recommended data elements, codes and mappings to reference vocabularies for the selected WHO guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Coding clerk<br />Data clerk          | 4413                                                                                                                                                      |
